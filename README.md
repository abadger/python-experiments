Experiment with whatever Python code strikes my fancy

This code might not be useful to anyone.  It is small pieces of code to try
things that I read a little bit about but don't have a larger use for yet.

## Warning: Multiple licenses in this code
All the code in here is licensed under and open source license but not the same
open source license.

Some code in here does not belong to me.  I've added them, usually to compare
and contrast against something that I'm experimenting with.

If you'd like to use some code here but are unclear on the licensing terms for
that piece, please ask me and I'll research whether I wrote it or where I got
it from so that you can be clear of the provenance and licensing terms.
